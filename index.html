              In the game of 2048, players slide numbered tiles on a 4x4 grid to
              combine identical numbers, with the ultimate goal of reaching the
              tile labeled "2048." The rules are simple:
              <strong
                >players make moves in four directions using their respective
                arrow keys on keyboard—up, down, left, or right—</strong
              >each turn causing all tiles to slide as far as possible in the
              chosen direction. When two tiles with the same number collide,
              they merge into a new tile with a value equal to the sum of their
              original values. New tiles with a value of 2 or 4 appear after
              each move. The game continues until the player is unable to make
              any more moves, leading to a conclusion. Strategic planning and
              careful positioning are key to achieving the highest score in this
              engaging puzzle game.
